    The default values for ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` will now be timezone-aware
    and derive their timezones from the local timezone on the system running the
    report process. A ``timezone`` report argument is also now available, which can
    be a timezone strong, and will override the timezone for automatically-generated
    values for the start and end date.
