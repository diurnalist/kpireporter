Reportcard documentation
========================

Reportcard is a **developer-friendly**, **highly customizable** tool for
sending periodic reports for the metrics that matter for your team or project.

Support for a variety of reporting sources is built-in, including, e.g., MySQL
databases, Prometheus metrics, and the Jenkins API. Reports can be sent via
email (with plugins for SMTP and SendGrid), Slack, or simply rendered as HTML.

.. note::

   **Author note**: I created this tool after being surprised that there was a
   distinct lack of simple developer-friendly reporting tools for
   communicating business and/or operational KPIs. I hope you find it useful
   as well. For more information, see :ref:`about-motivation`.
